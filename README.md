# Training Deep Neural Networks

This repository provides resources and code for training deep neural networks using Keras and TensorFlow. The focus is on practical implementations, model evaluations, and the integration of various techniques to enhance model performance.

## Features

- **Keras Model Implementations**: Examples of building and training deep learning models using Keras.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilities for preparing data for model training.
- **Model Evaluation**: Tools for assessing model performance using various metrics.
- **Callbacks**: Custom callbacks for training monitoring and early stopping.

## Notebooks
- **`master_assignment.ipynb`**: An assignment I did in my master's about Neural Networks
- **`training_deep_neural_networks.ipynb`**: In this notebook, we will be comparing different activation functions common in the development of Deep Neural Networks
- **`neural_nets_with_keras.ipynb`**: In this notebook we will be playing with different datasets while solving some Artificial Neural Networks exercises
